This [website](https://rysebaert.github.io/nepal_expe/) proposes some data visualizations of the fabulous **Himalayan database**, a compilation of records for all expeditions in Nepal Himalaya. It takes the form of a dashboard where user can explore several dimensions of indicators included in the database. 

A section is dedicated to peak data visualization with some indicators (height, ascent number, first ascent, sherpa hired rate, death rates, etc.). It includes only peaks above 6700 m, due to lack of time (173 peaks over the 479 of the Himalayan database). But this selection cover most of the recorded expeditions (10337 over the 11323 included in the database). 

Another is dedicated to expedition members, aggregated a country level for several time periods. For this dataset, all expeditions are included (also ascent below 6700m). It covers 87156 recorded expedition members and 40785 unique persons (some indivuals making several ascents). 

The technical aim of this website is to test the integration of .ojs and .R workflows in quarto dashboards.
