## The Himalayan Database

The [Himalayan Database](http://www.himalayandatabase.com/) is a compilation of records for all expeditions that have climbed in the Nepal Himalaya. The database is based on the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime journalist based in Kathmandu, and it is supplemented by information gathered from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers.

The data cover all expeditions from 1905 through Autumn-Winter 2023 to the most significant mountaineering peaks in Nepal. Also included are expeditions to both sides of border peaks such as Everest, Cho Oyu, Makalu and Kangchenjunga as well as to some smaller border peaks. Data on expeditions to trekking peaks are included for early attempts, first ascents and major accidents.*

Each expedition record contains detailed information including dates, routes, camps, use of supplemental oxygen, successes, deaths and accidents.

Each expedition record contains biographical information for all members listed on the permit as well as for hired members (e.g., Sherpas) for which there are significant events such as a summit success, death, accident or rescue.

In 2024 (Autumn - Winter 2023 update), this database includes 479 peals, more than 11300 expedition records, 87100 members records
